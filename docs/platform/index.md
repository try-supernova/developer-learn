The Pluto Platform refers to a variety of toolkits that are used for building and deploying Pluto at enterprise-level.  
These toolkits are not generally available. Access to these toolkits can be granted by contacting us at [pluto@stretch.wtf](mailto:pluto.stretch.wtf)

## Kernel Versioning
The Pluto Kernel uses the following versioning scheme:  
`<major>.<minor>.<build>.<branch>-<commit>.<timestamp>`  

`<build>`, `<branch>`, `<commit>`, and `<timestamp>` are all determined automatically. `<build>` is incremented when a new build is created with the same major.minor version. `<timestamp>` is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.

## Program Versioning
Pluto programs make use of many different versioning schemes. Consult the documentation for the program you are using for more information.
