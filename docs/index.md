Welcome to the official open-source set of developer documentation articles for Supernova. These pages cover a variety of topics, including

* [Creating an app](guide/kernel/41worker.md)
* [Creating beautiful GUIs](guide/design/xui)
* [Using the APIs via Satellite](/guide/satellite)
* [Deploying Supernova](/platform)
* And many more things!

We've also made this entire documentation fully open-source on GitHub:
https://github.com/try-supernova/developer-learn.
So, if you spot any errors, feel free to jump in and contribute to the repository.
We also encourage you to add new pages if you feel there's anything missing.

## Purpose
This documentation is meant to serve as a quickstart for Supernova app developers.
This documentation serves as your launchpad for creating applications for Supernova.
Think of it as your guidebook to navigate Supernova's world and unleash its potential.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Supernova offers tools to streamline the development process.
Orbit1, your companion CLI tool, helps bundle your application code into a single, efficient package. 
Satellite, another key component, acts as a bridge between your code and the Supernova system,
allowing your application to interact with Supernova's features.

Supernova is a web-based operating system ([webtop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webtop)).
Unlike traditional operating systems that run on your computer, Supernova runs entirely within a web browser. This makes it accessible from any device with a web browser, regardless of the underlying operating system.
It is designed to be a fast, complete, and secure operating system able to be run on any device.
