Welcome to the official open-source set of developer documentation articles for Pluto. These pages cover a variety of topics, including

* [Creating an app](guide/satellite/41worker)
* [Creating beautiful GUIs](guide/design/xui)
* [Using the APIs via Satellite](/guide/satellite)
* [Deploying Pluto](/platform)
* And many more things!

We've also made this entire documentation fully open-source on GitHub:
https://github.com/use-pluto/developer-learn.
So, if you spot any errors, feel free to jump in and contribute to the repository.
We also encourage you to add new pages if you feel there's anything missing.

## Purpose
This documentation is meant to serve as a quickstart for Pluto app developers.
This documentation serves as your launchpad for creating applications for Pluto.
Think of it as your guidebook to navigate Pluto's world and unleash its potential.
Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Pluto offers tools to streamline the development process.
Orbit1, your companion CLI tool, helps bundle your application code into a single, efficient package. 
Satellite, another key component, acts as a bridge between your code and the Pluto system,
allowing your application to interact with Pluto's features.

Pluto is a web-based operating system ([webtop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webtop)).
Unlike traditional operating systems that run on your computer, Pluto runs entirely within a web browser. This makes it accessible from any device with a web browser, regardless of the underlying operating system.
It is designed to be a fast, complete, and secure operating system able to be run on any device.
