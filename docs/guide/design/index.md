Extensible Design is a brand new Pluto-based design language.
# About

Extensible Design prioritizes flexibility and future-proofing. It emphasizes building a system that can readily adapt and grow.
This allows Pluto to seamlessly integrate new features and functionalities without major reworks. By breaking down functionalities into well-defined modules,
extensibility fosters independent development and easier integration of third-party plugins, fostering a vibrant ecosystem around Pluto.

:::tip Regarding Abbreviations, Capitalization
While XUI is an abbreviation for *eXtensible User Interface*, Extensible Design should not have a capitalized X, nor should it be abbreviated as ED.
If abbreviation is a must, refer to Extensible Design as extdesign.

Extensible Design is still in its early stages, and its documentation is a work in progress.
