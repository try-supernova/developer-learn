Extensible Design is a design language for Supernova.
# About

Extensible Design is a design system based on [BlueprintUI](https://blueprintui.dev/) that prioritizes flexibility and future-proofing. It emphasizes building a system that can readily adapt and grow.
This allows Supernova to seamlessly integrate new features and functionalities without major reworks. By breaking down functionalities into well-defined modules,
extensibility fosters independent development and easier integration of third-party plugins, fostering a vibrant ecosystem around Supernova.

:::tip Regarding Abbreviations, Capitalization
While XUI is an abbreviation for *eXtensible User Interface*, Extensible Design should not have a capitalized X, nor should it be abbreviated as ED.
If abbreviation is a must, refer to Extensible Design as extdesign.

Extensible Design is still in its early stages, and its documentation is a work in progress.

## Principles

Extensible Design is built on the following principles:

1. **Flexibility**: The design system should be able to adapt to new features and functionalities without major reworks.
2. **Modularity**: The design system should be broken down into well-defined modules that can be developed independently.
3. **Consistency**: The design system should maintain a consistent look and feel across all components.

Currently, Extensible Design does not recognize inclusivity and accessibility as core principles.  

A few of the things that set Extensible Design apart from other design systems are:

1. **Cursor Design**: Extensible Design recognizes that the cursor is an essential part of the user experience. Almost all components in Extensible Design use the default cursor.
2. **Roundness**: Extensible Design uses a consistent border-radius across all components.
3. **Color Palette**: Extensible Design uses a consistent color palette across all components. *The color palette is something very important we are still trying to get right, so although it is complete and consistent, Supernova's implementation uses grayscale colors.*
