[Satellite](https://github.com/try-supernova/satellite) is an SDK for building Supernova programs written in TypeScript.
It provides a variety of different APIs for communicating with Supernova, creating interfaces, and more.

## Getting Started
First, create a new directory for your project.
Consider using a source control system such as Git to manage your project.  
Next, run `npm init` to create a new `package.json` file.
Then, Satellite can be installed via NPM.
```bash
npm install @try-supernova/satellite
```

## Building
Supernova programs can be built using any standard JavaScript/TypeScript/CoffeeScript bundler.
We recommend using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), or [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).
