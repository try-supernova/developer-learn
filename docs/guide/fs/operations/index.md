title: Filesystem Operations
---

Supernova provides a variety of filesystem operations that can be used to interact with the filesystem.

## Understanding operations
Under the hood, an operation is a function that is called by the system to perform a specific task.
Operations are used to interact with the filesystem, and they are the building blocks of the filesystem APIs.

In the context of Supernova, operations are [system calls](/guide/kernel/communication/calls) used to interact with the filesystem.
